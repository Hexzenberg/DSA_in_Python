    "# <center> Linked Lists\n",
    "##### - This is the second notebook of the Python DSA repository and will cover all the concepts and tips for Linked Lists.\n",
    "##### - Starting from the definition and implementation to usage everything will be explained in simpler terms.\n",
    "##### After arrays the next data structure that we will discuss is known as linked list.\n",
    "##### Now, mind you I am not a Computer Science genius or a professor so I will explain this topic to you the way I get it; in simpler terms despite that I might still throw some cs jargons once in a while.\n",
    "##### So with that I will define linked lists in my very own words:\n",
    "#### Linked Lists are the type of linear data structure like arrays in which the previous element has the reference of the next element in the sequence such that each of the elements has two parts in it; ***data*** (or value) and ***reference*** for the next element.\n",
    "##### So for example a linked list looks like 1->2->3, in this structure the element '1' actually has two things stored in it one is the data 1 it self and the other is the reference to the next data element that is '2'.\n",
    "##### These are mainly of two types:\n",
    "> - Singly Linked Lists (Only refers the next element)\n",
    "> - Doubly Linked Lists (Refers both the previous and the next element)\n",
    "##### Singly linked lists implemention:"
