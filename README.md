# DSA in Python 

#### This repository will be updated until I add the implementation of almost all of the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) in Python prgramming language.
##### This type of project was long due for me since I am trying to get better at Artificial Intelligence coding and implementation and python is a major part of it.
##### This repository has all the topics that are a part of the Data Structures curriculum be it graphs or dynamic programming.
##### Each of the topics will be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook along with their most premier and known algorithms present in it.
