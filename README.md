# DSA in Python 

##### Trying to learn Python by implementing all the Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) concepts using it. 
##### This type of project was long due for me since I am trying to get better at Artificial Intelligence coding and implementation and python is a major part of it.
##### I will also be refreshing my Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) practice in this project.
##### This repository has all the topics that are a part of the Data Structures curriculum be it graphs or dynamic programming.
##### Each of the topics will be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook along with their most premier and known algorithms present in it.
##### I will also add a final notebook for you C++ folks to help map every useful function from C++ to Python.
##### This could be a great interview prep start tool along with practicing questions on your own after reading a topic.
